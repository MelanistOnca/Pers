//NOTE NOTE NOTE the thing where you can 'scroll' through left/right like on amazon is i believe called a carousel

//localized styles in the elements themselves take precedence over inherited styles. May need to adjust what/how is locally styled for button-press restyling to work
const amazonMimic = {
  // placeholder: 'value'
  backgroundColor: "yellow",
  color: "blue",
  linkText: {
    color: "blue",
  },
  bodyLayout: {

  }
}
